This repository hosts data descriptors, scripts, and reproducible analyses for the study on morphometric traits, seed germination, early seedling development, and molecular diversity based on SSR markers in *Euterpe edulis* from Espírito Santo (Brazil). The material is organized to support reuse in breeding, conservation planning, and nursery decision-making.

## Highlights
- Thirteen phenotypic traits spanning fruits, seeds, emergence, and early growth.
- REML/BLUP mixed-model framework for variance components, heritability, and genetic values.
- Pearson correlations and path analysis identifying direct effects on Dickson’s Quality Index (DQI).
- SSR-based molecular diversity (8 loci) with PIC and heterozygosity metrics.
- Genotype clustering (UPGMA), Mantel test across molecular and genotypic distances.
- Practical guidance for assembling ex situ germplasm collections and founding breeding populations.

## Repository contents
- **data/** raw and processed datasets, plus a detailed data dictionary.
