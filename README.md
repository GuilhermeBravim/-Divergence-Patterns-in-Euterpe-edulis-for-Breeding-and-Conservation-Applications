## About the study

The study investigates **fruit and seed morphometrics, germination performance, seedling growth, and molecular diversity** in *Euterpe edulis*.  
Key contributions include:

- Estimation of variance components and heritability using REML/BLUP.  
- Correlation and path analysis to identify direct effects on seedling quality.  
- Assessment of genetic divergence among 72 genotypes with SSR markers.  
- Practical recommendations for germplasm conservation and breeding programs.  

These results provide valuable insights for the establishment of **ex situ germplasm collections** and the development of a breeding foundation population for this threatened Atlantic Forest palm.
